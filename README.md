# The #100DaysOfCode bot ðŸ¤–

[@100xcode](https://twitter.com/100xcode) celebrates you as you are learning how to code by _instantly_ interacting with your progress tweets. Once you tweet, the bot checks whether your tweet is relevant to #100DaysOrCode. If relevant, the bot will immediately like/retweet/follow you. Please note that the bot _sometimes_ cannot follow you due to limitations on behalf of Twitterâ€™s API.

The botâ€™s code is open source (written in Go) and hosted on Google Cloud Platform using an _almost free_ virtual machine. Still, the bot is deployed using Docker, making deployments 100% serverless. If youâ€™re curious about any of this, youâ€™re more than welcome to [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/username_ZAYDEK).
